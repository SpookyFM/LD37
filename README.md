You are stranded on an enemy planet. Your spaceship was hit by the first wave of a meteorite storm. A human being was on the same escape buoy as you. He is unconscious but stable.

The sensor data downloaded to your memory core before disconnection from the main hub indicates that the main meteorite shower will hit this system very soon. You will have to fortify the buoy into the one-room survival shelter using the blueprint BP_SR_01. You need more resources to do this. Gather available iron ore found on the ground.

Local sensor data indicates insufficient freely available iron ore for rapid construction. However, enemy AI presence was detected. Defeat enemies to gather more resources.

The mobile unit has a limited resource cache. Bring resources back to the survival buoy and transfer them to the construction unit. You can build the necessary pieces for the survival shelter or upgrade your weapons systems.
